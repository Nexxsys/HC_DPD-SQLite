# HC_DPD-SQLite
This a personal project to "automate" the download of the latest Health Canada Drug Product Data Extracts (i.e. allfiles.zip) and import them into an SQLite database for use.  My personal preference is to focus on python and php for "front-end" use of this data.  

*Note:* You must ensure you have SQLite3 Installed. 

### For Linux (Ubuntu)
```sudo apt-get install sqlite3 
```

### For Linux (Arch)
See the [Arch Wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/SQLite)

### For Windows
Download the the sqlite tools from here: https://sqlite.org/download.html under the Precompiled Binaries for Windows section.
